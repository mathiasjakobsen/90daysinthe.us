# Travlr

A travel blog created with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/). Design is largely stolen/inspired by [mediator](https://github.com/dirkfabisch/mediator) by [@dirkfabish](https://github.com/dirkfabisch).

## Features
- Post list is an auto-generated Mapbox with markers for each post
- Keep track of how far you have traveled
- Track your spendings, on your trip
- Use keyboard shortcuts to navigate (uses [Mousetrap](https://github.com/ccampbell/mousetrap))

## Features
- Fully Responsive layout
- Use header images in articles, if you want to (add tag "image" and url to the image in the front matter section of a post)
- Minimal design
- Featured article support
- FontAwesome implemented for easy use of icons fonts
- Free & Open Source Font usage

## Installation
```bash
$ bundle install
$ bundle exec jekyll server
```

You should have a server up and running locally at <http://localhost:4000>.
